In order to download this code from the repository, one must have a software such as VS Code or one that's similar. Along with VS Code, it is necessary to download Node.JS.

After downloading Node.JS, it is important to install the packages associated with this app in order to be able to access its full properties.

Before opening this app in VS Code, make sure to Git Clone this project otherwise all packages will have to be installed manually.

Begin by opening the terminal, and typing in "npm init -y" as this will set a basic package.json file. 

Now we can install everything by typing "npm install" and it will install the packages that have been installed into this app.

Lastly before we test this app, we can run "npm run develop" in the terminal to connect to the server.
